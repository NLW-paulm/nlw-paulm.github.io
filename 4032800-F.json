Letters were received by Sergeant Major Fear from various fronts, including those in both Western and Eastern Europe, Palestine and Mesopotamia. Although predominantly letters of thanks, some provide valuable information with regard to local servicemen and on conditions within the trenches. Some letters contain detailed descriptions of the fighting, the weather and of life in general on the front line. The letters also include poems written by soldiers recounting their experiences. Particularly detailed letters are referred to in the descriptions at file level."
