          "Edwin Miles (c1869-1929) was born in Bristol, the son of Joseph Miles and his wife Sarah Ann, but by the date of the 1881 census his family had moved to Llanfihangel, Llantarnam, Monmouthshire. In January 1892 he married Mary Emma Thomas at Llantrisant parish church when he was described  as a signalman of St George-super-Ely. By 1901 he was living in Cowbridge Road, Oldcastle. The earliest evidence for his photographic career is a postcard published by him of John Street, Porthcawl, postmarked 1905 (DART/V/203: withdrawn from Glamorgan Archives by the depositor ). He ran photographic studios at number 40 Ewenny Road, Bridgend, and High Street, Cowbridge, primarily photographing family groups, weddings and parties. A report on his funeral can be found in the May 10th issue of the Glamorgan Gazette on page 5."
